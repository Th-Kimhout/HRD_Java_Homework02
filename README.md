# HRD_Java_Homework02 Online Bank Management System

## Overview

The **Online Bank Management System** is a Java-based application that allows users to manage bank accounts efficiently. It supports two types of accounts:

- **Checking Account**
- **Saving Account**

Users can perform essential banking operations such as:

- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Transfer funds between accounts
- Delete an account
- View transaction history

Additionally, the savings account offers an interest incentive where deposits over \$200 receive an extra 5% interest, applied directly to the entire amount over \$200.

## Features

- Create and manage **Checking** and **Saving** accounts.
- **Deposit** money into an account.
- **Withdraw** funds from an account.
- **Transfer** funds between accounts.
- **Delete** an account when needed.
- **View transaction history** to track all deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Interest Calculation**: If a deposit into a Savings Account exceeds \$200, an additional 5% interest is directly applied to the amount over \$200.
